                            If you are just starting out it's a great idea to join a group 
                            with interests common to you. The advantage to joining a group 
                            is that you will have people to compete with and there will be 
                            activity types ready for you to use. It is recommended that 
                            newcomers join a group.

                            If you cannot find a group that matches your interests or 
                            you are joining this site with a group of people you intend 
                            to track activites with together, you may wish to create your 
                            own group. Simply go to the groups page and click on the Create 
                            New Group button to load a form for creating a new group. Simply 
                            fill out the form to make your own group. After that you will 
                            want to register some new activity types so the members of your 
                            group can register their activities.

                            Before you can log an activty, you will need to create at least one activity 
                            type. Each activity type is given a name and a score modifier when it is 
                            created. When a user logs an activity they select an activity type that best 
                            fits the activity they performed. The score modifier from the activity type 
                            will determine the score they recieve for the activity. We recommend that 
                            each score modifier be based on the difficulty of the activity. For example, 
                            the score modifier for a 'walking' activity type in a group for fitness 
                            should be lower than the score modifier for 'running'.
                            <br>
                            If you are the administrator for your group then any Activity Type that 
                            you register will automatically be approved. Otherwise, your group's 
                            administrator will have to edit and approve the activity type before it
                            can be used.

                            When you have performed an activity you can log it on the Activity Log 
                            page to register it either for yourself or for the group you are a part
                            of. At the bottom of the page you will be able to find a button labeled 
                            "Log New Activity". When you click on this button a menu will appear 
                            where you can enter the information about your activity. If you do not 
                            see an Activity Type that best fits your activity, you can always register
                            a new one.

                            Once an activity is logged, it will appear in the table of activities on 
                            the Activity Log page. If you click on the name of the activity a menu will
                            pop up with information about the activity. If it is an activity that you
                            registered, then you will be able to edit or delete the activity through that
                            menu as well.

                        Doing Together works best as a group platform, but if you just want 
                        to try it out, or groups are just not for you, then the site will 
                        still allow you to track all of your activities. And if you want 
                        to join a group later on, you will not have to make a new account.
